# NOTICE -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notice that you can overwrite an exact regex definition within the Scanner's 
# signatures with your own definition. That means that if there is a definition 
# for "\\ncat\.exe", you can overwrite the score given by THOR by defining 
# exactly the same regex. 
# You are able to the reduce the score given by THOR by negative score 
# definitions like "\\bin\\ncat\.exe;-40" to exclude ncats that are located in
# a typical directory of e.g. a Cygwin installation. If "ncat" is detected in a
# different directory, the reduction will not take place. 

# Ncat Example
# bin\\nc\.exe;-20
